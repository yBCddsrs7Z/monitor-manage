# Current Status - 2025-10-04 02:37

## ‚úÖ FIXED
1. **Config loading** - All 3 groups now load correctly
2. **Display detection fallback** - Get-DisplayInfo fallback working
3. **Display names from WMI** - Now extracting real names (e.g., "HX Armada 27")
4. **Stable identifiers** - Using InstanceName/SerialNumber instead of unstable DisplayId

## ‚úÖ WORKING
- Audio switching (confirmed in logs)
- Enable-all displays (confirmed in logs)
- Configurator loads all groups
- Auto-renumbering
- Debug logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS
**Display Switching** - Detection works, but matching incomplete:

### Current Behavior:
```
[INFO] Discovered 3 display(s) on the system.
[INFO] Requested display 'NE160WUM-NX2' to be active.
[INFO] Requested display 'Beyond TV' to be active.
[INFO] Requested display 'HX Armada 27' to be disabled.
```

Displays are detected but not matched to config names yet.

### Why:
Your config has names that were probably entered manually when displays weren't all detected:
- `NE160WUM-NX2` (panel model number)
- `Beyond TV` (TV name)
- `HX Armada 27` (real monitor name - **this one matches!**)

### Current Export Shows:
```json
{
  "Name": "HX Armada 27",
  "DisplayId": "1",
  "InstanceName": "DISPLAY\\HPN3812\\5&13619720&4&UID513_0",
  "SerialNumber": "CNK2282SP8"
}
```

Only 1 display exported (others not active or laptop closed).

## üîß NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Re-configure with Real Names
1. Connect ALL displays
2. Open laptop screen
3. Run: `pwsh -File scripts/export_devices.ps1`
4. Open configurator (`Left Alt+Left Shift+9`)
5. Edit each group to pick displays from the detected list
6. The configurator will use the real WMI names

### Option 2: I Complete the Matching Logic
Add fuzzy matching so your current config names find the displays:
- Match "NE160WUM-NX2" ‚Üí look for panel models in InstanceName
- Match "Beyond TV" ‚Üí search for TV-related keywords
- Already matches "HX Armada 27" ‚úì

## üìä Test Results
- 54/54 tests passing ‚úÖ
- Display detection: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- Audio switching: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- Config loading: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- Display matching: **IN PROGRESS** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üéØ Recommendation
**Option 1** is faster and cleaner - let the configurator show you the real detected names and reconfigure. Your current names won't match because some were entered when displays weren't all connected.

Would you like me to:
- A) Complete fuzzy matching logic (30-60 min)
- B) Wait for you to reconfigure with real names (5 min for you)
